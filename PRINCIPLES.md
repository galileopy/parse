# Parse Development Principles

This document outlines key principles for maintaining code quality, consistency, and reliability in the Parse project. Adhere to these when making changes to ensure the codebase remains robust and easy to extend.

1. **Fail Hard with Thrown Errors**: On failures (e.g., I/O errors, invalid states), throw exceptions (Error or subclasses) instead of returning masked values like strings. This promotes explicit handling, better debugging, and avoids silent failures. Mask only at user-facing boundaries (e.g., CLI output) by catching and logging.
2. **Strict Typing**: Use TypeScript fullyâ€”never use 'any' in any type definition; prefer type guards/unions/interfaces. All functions/parameters/returns typed explicitly.
3. **Modularity and Single Responsibility**: Keep files/functions focused (e.g., config.ts only handles auth persistence). Use small, testable units.
4. **Incremental Changes**: Updates should be small, testable, and keep the system functional. Include tests for each change.
5. **User-Friendly CLI**: Errors/notifications should be clear and actionable in the REPL, but internal logic fails hard.
6. **Test Colocation and Coverage**: Place \*.test.ts beside sources, cover happy/error paths, use isolation (e.g., temp dirs, no state bleed).

## Code Organization and Architecture

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with Dependency Injection (DI)**: Structure the codebase using classes implementing interfaces for services (e.g., IConfigService, ILlmService). Use constructor-based DI to decouple modules, promoting reusability, testability, and adherence to SOLID principles (e.g., Single Responsibility via focused classes, Dependency Inversion via interfaces).
- **Encapsulation and Abstraction**: Encapsulate state and logic within classes (e.g., private cachedConfig in ConfigService); expose only necessary public methods. Avoid global state; use cached instances where appropriate.
- **Async Loop and Event Handling**: Maintain the REPL as a simple async loop with readline in ReplOrchestrator, dispatching inputs to modular handlers without complex frameworks.
