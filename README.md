# Parse

## Purpose

Parse is a command-line tool designed to assist developers with coding tasks using large language models (LLMs). It provides code suggestions, debugging help, and workflow automation, making it a versatile coding assistant.

## Status

As of July 12, 2025, Parse is in active development. Recent updates include authentication with the xAI API, file read/write operations, and a simple CLI REPL with commands for help, quit, and login.

Completed: CLI REPL with readline; commands for file ops (/read, /write), help (/help), quit (/quit or /exit), and authentication (/login); API key validation and storage in ~/.parse/config.json. 

**In Progress**: Basic LLM prompt handling and integration. Upcoming: Tool protocol for advanced features like code execution, testing, and versioning. The modular design ensures extensibility, with features like config management, file operations, and commands separated for easy maintenance.

## Project Details

Parse explores LLMs for code assistance, emphasizing modularity and extensibility. This project is being written by Grok: 99% of the code is generated by Grok via prompts on grok.com or the xAI Grok API. The developer simply writes prompts, copy-pastes the artifacts, and makes minor tweaks.

## Key Technologies

- Node.js: For the CLI runtime.
- TypeScript: For type safety and maintainability.
- xAI API: For LLM integration (authentication implemented; full prompt handling forthcoming).

## Development Approach

Incremental builds maintain a working system at each stage. Features are developed in small, testable units, with tests covering happy and error paths. See principles.md for guidelines like strict typing and failing hard with errors.

For next steps, see TODO.md.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/galileopy/parse.git
cd parse
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the application:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This launches the CLI with a `Parse >` prompt. Available commands:

- `/read <path>`: Read the file at the given path.
- `/write <path> <content>`: Write content to the file.
- `/help [command|command|...]`: Show help (e.g., `/help read|write` for specific commands or `/help` for all).
- `/login <provider> <apiKey>`: Save and validate authentication config (e.g., provider: xAI).
- `/quit` or `/exit`: Exit the application.

Non-command inputs are echoed back. Authentication loads on startup; if missing or invalid, use `/login` to set it up.
