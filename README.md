# Parse

## Purpose
Parse is a command-line tool that uses large language models (LLMs) to assist developers with coding tasks, offering code suggestions, debugging help, and workflow automation.

## Status
This is the initial commit as of June 13, 2025, serving as a placeholder. It marks the first step in building Parse into a coding assistant.

## Next Steps
- Outline core features and structure.
- Build the command-line interface.
- Integrate LLM for coding support.

More to come as development progresses!
