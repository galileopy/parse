# Parse

## Purpose
Parse is a command-line tool that uses large language models (LLMs) to assist developers with coding tasks, offering code suggestions, debugging help, and workflow automation.

## Status
This is the initial commit as of June 13, 2025, serving as a placeholder. It marks the first step in building Parse into a coding assistant.

## Project Details
This is a personal experiment aimed at exploring LLM capabilities for code assistance. The majority of the code for Parse is intended to be generated using outputs from the [grok.com web app](https://grok.com) or the [xAI Grok API](https://x.ai/api).

## Attribution
Outputs generated by the [grok.com web app](https://grok.com) or the [xAI Grok API](https://x.ai/api) are used in this project and are attributed as follows: **Written with Grok**, in accordance with [xAIâ€™s Brand Guidelines](https://x.ai/legal/brand-guidelines).

## Next Steps
- Outline core features and structure.
- Build the command-line interface.
- Integrate LLM for coding support.

More to come as development progresses!
