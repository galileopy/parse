## Next Steps

0. ~~**Project Setup**~~
   - Lint format and build settings
   - Install initial dependencies

1. ~~**Initial Setup and Prototype**:~~
   - Implement the initial xstream dialog with an echo sink to test the basic event loop.
   - Set up the TypeScript project with `xstream` and `readline` for CLI input.

2. **Authentication and API Integration**:
   - Implement the `login` command to handle authentication with xAI API.
   - Store and manage API keys securely in the application state.

3. **Basic Interaction**:
   - Enable parsing of user prompts and fetching responses from the LLM.
   - Implement a queue for handling multiple prompts to manage asynchronous responses.

4. **Tool Protocol and Basic Tools**:
   - Define and implement a protocol for tool interactions (consider MCP or a custom protocol).
   - Implement basic tools:
     - **Run command**: Allow reading and writing commands.
     - **File system operations**: Create, edit, list, find, rename, and delete files.
     - **Versioning**: Create snapshots before edits and commit changes.

5. **Advanced Features**:
   - Extend tool calling to support:
     - Writing code
     - Running code
     - Writing tests
     - Running tests
     - Debugging assistance

6. **System Considerations**:
   - Study Cycle.js to understand and implement necessary drivers for the application.
   - Ensure the system design prevents circular function invocation loops, possibly through static analysis or careful stream management.
   - Add delays to streams where necessary to handle timing issues.
   - Implement state management where the state acts as both a sink and a source, ensuring the feedback loop is correctly managed.

7. **Extensibility and Plugins**:
   - Design a plugin system to allow dynamic registration of new event types and handlers.
   - Ensure the system is modular and can be extended without modifying core logic.

8. **CLI Polish and Distribution**:
   - Enhance the CLI interface with colored output (e.g., using `chalk`) and improved prompts for better user experience.
   - Set up the build system to compile and bundle the application.
   - Configure the CLI entry point for easy installation and usage.

## Additional Notes
- **Commands**: All commands are single words (e.g., `model` instead of `pick model`).
- **Tool Protocol**: Decide on using MCP or a simpler internal protocol for tool interactions.
- **State Management**: Pay special attention to how state is handled to maintain a working system at each milestone.
- **Testing**: Simulate user inputs, commands, and API responses to validate each component as itâ€™s developed.
